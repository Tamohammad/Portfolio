It's a simple, one-page layout with distinct sections including Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The design, first conceptualized in Figma for both mobile and desktop modes, follows a clean and modern aesthetic. Developed using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this site embodies a mobile-first approach and integrates Web3Forms for the contact section.
